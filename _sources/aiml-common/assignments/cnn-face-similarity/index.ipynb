    "### Introduction\n",
    "Typically when we train a Convolutional Neural Network as an end-to-end image classifier, we input an image to the network, which gets propagated through the network (feed forward).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then obtain our posterior probabilities at the end of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no “rule” that says we must allow the image to forward propagate through the entire network that includes the head. Instead, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Stop propagation at a layer before the head of the network (such as an activation or pooling layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Extract the logits at this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Treat the values as a feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now these feature vectors can be utilized in other downstream tasks like classification. Our aim is to create a system where an input query image will be responded by a number of  images that have strong resemblance to the query image. This particular task is called **similarity search**. A naive way to perform this task, would be to compare images based on pixel values, patches, or some other high level feature taken from the image itself. You are askd to use the ResNet-50 architecture to produce features that can represent a concept aka a face with specific characteristics. "
