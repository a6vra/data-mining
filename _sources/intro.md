## What this course is all about  

This course is all about making you love the methods that can extract meaning from big data. 

In this course we will challenge you with exciting data-intensive problems and teach you from the ground up the concepts and methodologies that will allow you to synthesize solutions that are based on statistical learning theory and implemented in Python. 

This course requires some intensive effort from your side in both learning these concepts and practicing them in your assigned projects. We hope that we will motivate you to work hard and have some fun along the way.
